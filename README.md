# Chasing Light Photographic Portfolio

[Link to live project](https://deanwraith24.github.io/photographic-portfolio/)

Chasing Light Photographic Portfolio is a portfolio site for my personal wildlife photography that I have taken in my time working in wildlife conservation in South Africa. The goal was to showcase my images in an easy to access and view style. The site consists of 4 pages that help to reach this goal.

### <u>Credits</u>

The content on the site was written by myself. The About me and Awards text is made up and non-factual or real. I used W3 Schools to trouble shoot some of the speed bumps I had and to get some ideas for the code I used in my form. I also used the course work from the Code Institute LMS.
